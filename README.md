# top-calculator
The Odin Project Foundation Course's final project
https://janbornindec.github.io/top-calculator/

What have I learned:
- Applying loops to events
- Function callbacks
- Manipulating variables
- Using null value

Main problems I encountered:
- Struggled with logic, lack the habit of writing Pseudocodes
- Started writing out the logic in one big function, using if/else
- Manipulating values of variables

How I overcame the problems:
- Splitting the codes within that one big function into smaller functions. Change the keyListener function into a reusable function that can apply to keys and buttons.
